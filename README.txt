# Compression Algorithms

The Compression package includes text processing implementations.
This offers the implementation for various compression algorithms.
Mainly suitable for ilustrative purposes to understand compression schemes

1) For b2zip:
    - includes Burrows Wheeler Transform as a plain version and offers a bijective implementation
    - includes Move-To-Front encoding
    - includes Huffman encoding scheme for efficient binary encoding

To **get started** have a look at the test files to see how to use the algorithms.
