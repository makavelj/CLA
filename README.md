# Compression Algorithms

This source code offers tools for simple string compression.
Mainly suitable for ilustrative purposes and own experiments.

1) For Entropy type:
    - includes Huffman encoding scheme for binary encoding
2) For Dictionary type:
    - includes plain LZ77 encoding
    - includes plain LZ78 encoding
3) For Transforms: 
    - includes Burrows Wheeler Transform as a plain version and offers a bijective implementation
    - includes Move-To-Front encoding

To **get started** have a look at the test files to see how to use compression.
