# Compression Algorithms

This source code offers tools for simple string compression.
Mainly suitable for ilustrative purposes and experiments.

1) For Entropy type:
    - includes Huffman encoding scheme for binary encoding
    - includes Shannon-Fano-Elias encoding
2) For Dictionary type:
    - includes plain LZ77 encoding
    - includes plain LZ78 encoding
3) For Transforms:
    - includes plain Burrows Wheeler Transform
    - includes bijective Burrows Wheeler Transform based on Lyndon Words
    - includes Move-To-Front encoding
4) For Pattern Recognition:
    - includes Decision Tree based on entropy

To **get started** have a look at the test files to see how to use compression.
