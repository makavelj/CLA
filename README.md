**C**ompression and **L**earning **A**lgorithms offers compression and learning algorithms.
The implementation is mainly suitable for ilustrative purposes of the interconection of the two topics.
The source code offers the following:

1) For Entropy type compression:
    - includes Huffman encoding scheme for binary coding
    - includes Shannon-Fano-Elias coding
2) For Dictionary type compression:
    - includes plain LZ77 encoding
    - includes LZW coding based on LZ78
3) For Transforms:
    - includes plain Burrows Wheeler Transform
    - includes bijective Burrows Wheeler Transform based on Lyndon Words
    - includes Move-To-Front encoding
4) For Pattern Recognition:
    - includes Decision Tree based on entropy of information
    - includes Vector Quantization based on K-Means
    - includes Principal Component Analysis based on Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
    - includes Boosting based on Decision Tree stumps

To **get started** have a look at the test files to see how to use compression and pattern recognition.
